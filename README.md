# XL4432-SMT

This project provides library for controlling the Si4430/31/32 wireless transceiver module via SPI. The library facilitates communication, allowing easy configuration and data transmission between devices. Key features include:
*Initialization and configuration of the transceiver.
*Register reading and writing over SPI.
*Seamless switching between various modes (standby, transmit, receive).
*Timed packet transmission every 2 seconds.

The library is designed to simplify the usage of the Si4430/31/32 in embedded projects and can be easily adapted to various applications requiring wireless communication.
